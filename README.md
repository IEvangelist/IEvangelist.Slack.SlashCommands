# Slack
### / Commands (slash commands)

#### Getting Started

This ASP.NET Core Web API application is hosted in Azure as an App Service. It is configured to leverage bitly, open weather map and the icndb apis. All of these APIs require various credentials and registration to consume them.

 - [Open Weather Map - Signup for API](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up)
 - [Bitly.com - Signup for API](https://bitly.com/a/sign_up)

Add environment variables for open weather map:

```
setx OpenWeatherMapOptions__Key [Your Key Here]
```

Add environment variables for bit.ly:

```
setx BitlyOptions__ApiKey [Your API Key Here]
setx BitlyOptions__Login [Your Login Here]
```

Visual Studio requires a restart after environment variables have been added.
